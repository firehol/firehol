DOCUMENTATION
-------------
If you received this program in as a RPM, documentation should be
installed at /usr/share/doc/firehol-X.XX.
Otherwise, documentation should be available in the doc/ directory
of the .tar.bz2 archive you received.

In any case, you can also find the documentation online, at:

                     http://firehol.sf.net


INSTALLATION
------------

RPM
~~~
RPM distributions automatically install the program. After a RPM
installation, FireHOL should be available at /etc/init.d/firehol
and its default configuration at /etc/firehol.conf.
Please use the chkconfig system utility to enable/disable
firehol's activity at boot time.

TAR.BZ2
~~~~~~~
This type of distribution includes all the files in the directory
where you uncompress it.
To make FireHOL start at boot time you have to add it to the startup
procedure of your operating system.

Three things are needed to start FireHOL properly:

1. Move firehol.sh to the directory where your startup scripts exist
   and rename it to firehol (i.e. remove the .sh).

2. Make sure FireHOL is called with something like:

         /path/to/startup/scripts/firehol start

3. Make sure there is a valid configuration file in /etc/firehol.conf

This is it.


IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
If you decide to use FireHOL regularly (or permanently) you have to
understand that it will control your firewall and therefore be a
key point of your security. You should do something to be notified
of bugs or other kind of problems as soon as they appear.

I suggest to subscribe to the notification engine of freshmeat.net
under this project or to monitor FireHOL's file releases at
sourceforge.net. Both of these services will keep you anonymous
(to me) but will update you if and when new releases become available.


CONTRIBUTING
------------
I'll be glad to receive your ideas, patches, case studies, service
definitions, etc.

Here is my e-mail: costa@tsaousis.gr

Please note however that this is my personal e-mail that I read
just once per day and in some cases, once every a few days. If you
want some faster response, you can always use the mailing lists
and forums under this project at sourceforge.

Kind Regard
