<small>
Primary commands form groups of rules within a FireHOL firewall.
The optional rule parameters given to the primary commands are <b>indirectly</b> applied to all sub-commands given within this primary command.
</small>
<p>

	<a name="interface"><h3><b>interface</b> <font color="red">&lt;real interface&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font> <b>[optional rule parameters]</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>interface</b> command creates a firewall for protecting the host the firewall is running, from the given interface.
	<br>The default interface policy is <b>drop</b>, so that if no subcommands are given, the
	firewall will just drop all incoming <b>and outgoing</b> traffic using this interface.
	<p>
	INPORTANT<br>
	Note that unlike ipchains, in <b>iptables</b> traffic passing through the firewall
	host (FORWARDed traffic) does not pass through the INPUT/OUTPUT chains of the firewall and
	therefore the <b>interface</b> rules in FireHOL never match it.
	To match the traffic passing through (even if DNATed) you have to place
	the filtering rules in <b>router</b> statements. <b>Interface</b>
	statements filter traffic <b>only from/to the firewall host</b>. Nothing else.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>real interface</b> is the interface name as shown by <b>ip link show</b>.
			Generally anything iptables accepts, including the pattern character + (the plus sign), is valid.
			<br>The plus sign after some text will match all interfaces that start with this text.
			<br>It is allowed to use more than one interfaces separated by spaces, but all of them should be
			given within one quoted argument:
			<br>Example: <b>interface "eth0 eth1 ppp0" myname</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>name</b> is a name for this interface.
			<br>Generally you should use short names (10 characters max) without spaces or other symbols.
			<br>You should not use the same name more than once in FireHOL primary commands.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched for this interface. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.
			<br>Example 1: <b>interface eth0 intranet src 10.0.0.0/16</b>
			<br>Example 2: <b>interface eth0 internet src not "$UNROUTABLE_IPS"</b>
			(note: UNROUTABLE_IPS is a variable defined by FireHOL that includes all IPs that should not be routable
			by the Internet).

	<a name="router"><h3><b>router</b> <font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font> <b>[optional rule parameters]</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>router</b> command creates a firewall for the traffic passing through the host running the firewall.
	The default policy on <b>router</b> commands is <b>return</b>. This means that by default no packets are dropped in a router.
	Packets not matched by any <b>router</b> command will be dropped at the end of the firewall.
	Change the default policy of a router only if you understand clearly what gets matched by the router statement. It is very common
	to have overlapping definitions of routers and changing this policy to anything other than the default may have strange results
	for your configuration. (Changing the policy on routers appeared in v1.248).
	<p>
	INPORTANT<br>
	Note that unlike ipchains, in <b>iptables</b> traffic passing through the firewall
	host (FORWARDed traffic) does not pass through the INPUT/OUTPUT chains of the firewall and
	therefore the <b>interface</b> rules in FireHOL never match it.
	To match the traffic passing through (even if DNATed) you have to place
	the filtering rules in <b>router</b> statements. <b>Interface</b>
	statements filter traffic <b>only from/to the firewall host</b>.
	<b>Router</b> statements filter traffic <b>that passes through the
	firewall host.</b>
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>name</b> is a name for this router.
			<br>The same restrictions of <b>interface</b> names apply here too.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched for this router. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
		</ul>
	
	Router statements produce similar iptables commands the interface statements produce.
	For each router statement an <b>in_<font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font></b> and an
	<b>out_<font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font></b> chain are produced to match the traffic
	in both directions of the router.
	<br>
	To match some client or server traffic the administrator has to specify the input/output
	interface or the source/destination of the request.
	All inface/outface, src/dst optional rule parameters can be given either on the <b>router</b>
	statement in which case will be applied to all subcommands for this <i>router</i>,
	or on each subcommand within a <b>router</b>.
	Both are valid.
	<br>
	For example:
	<pre>
		router mylan inface ppp+ outface eth0
			server http accept
			client smtp accept
	</pre>
	The above says: Define a router that matches all <u>requests</u> that originate from some PPP interface and go out to eth0.<br>
	There is an HTTP server in eth0 that client from the PPP interfaces are allowed to reach.<br>
	Clients on eth0 are allowed to get SMTP traffic from the PPP interfaces.<br>
	<br>
	While:
	<pre>
		router mylan
			server http accept inface ppp+ outface eth0
			server smtp accept inface eth0 outface ppp+
	</pre>
	The above says: Define a router that matches any kind of forwarded traffic.<br>
	For HTTP traffic the clients are on a PPP interface and the servers on eth0.<br>
	For SMTP traffic the clients are on a eth0 interface and the servers o a PPP interface.
	<p>
	Please note that in the second example the SMTP traffic is matched again with a <b>server</b> subcommand,
	not a <b>client</b> (as in the first example).
	<p>
	The <b>client</b> subcommand <u>reverses</u> all the optional rules that are applied <u>indirectly</u> to it.
	Indirect rule parameters are those that are inherited from the parent command (<b>router</b> in this case).
	<br>
	To make it simple, for FireHOL a <b>client</b> is: "a <b>server</b> with all the implicit optional rule parameters reversed".
	<p>
	So, in the first example, the <b>client</b> simply flipped the inface and outface rules defined at the <b>router</b>
	and became an SMTP <b>server</b>.
	<br>In the second example there is nothing to be flipped, so <b>server</b> and <b>client</b>
	are exactly the same.<p>
	I suggest to use <b>client</b> subcommands in routers only if you have inface/outface or src/dst in the <b>router</b> statements.
	If you are building routers like the second example, don't use <b>client</b>, it is confusing.
	<p>
	Older versions of FireHOL did not allow server and client subcommands in routers.
	Only the <b>route</b> subcommand was allowed. Today, <b>route</b> is just an alias for <b>server</b> and can be
	used only in routers, not interfaces.
	<p>
	Any number of <b>router</b> statements can exist. Since the policy is RETURN on all of them, any traffic
	not matched by a <i>router</i> will continue to be checked against the second.

	The <b>policy</b> subcommand defines the default policy for an <b>interface</b>.
	<p>
	This directive accepts all the actions specified in <a href="#actions">Actions</a>.
	<p>
	<b>Please note that FireHOL is only useful for "DROP/REJECT EVERYTHING, ALLOW EXPLICITLY" type of firewalls.

	<a name="protection"><h3><b>protection</b> [reverse] <font color="red">&lt;type&gt;</font> [requests/sec [burst]]</h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>protection</b> subcommand sets a number of protection rules on an <b>interface</b>.
	<p>
	In router configurations, <b>protections</b> are setup on <b>inface</b>. The <b>reverse</b> keyword will make the
	protections setup on <b>outface</b>. Please note that the <b>reverse</b> keyword must be the first given.
	Otherwise it will not work.
	<p>
	<b>type</b> can be: <br>
	<ul><b>strong</b>, or <b>full</b>, or <b>all</b>
	<br>turns on all the possible protections.
	<br>Currently it includes: invalid fragments new-tcp-w/o-syn icmp-floods syn-floods malformed-xmas malformed-null malformed-bad.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>bad-packets</b>
	<br>turns on all the possible protections that detect bad packets based one the packet contents themselves, not the packets transfer rate.
	<br>Currently it includes: invalid fragments new-tcp-w/o-syn malformed-xmas malformed-null malformed-bad.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>invalid</b>
	<br>Drops all incoming INVALID packets. Invalid packets are those that are matched by "-m state --state INVALID", so they are all those
	packets that the iptables connection tracker believes are INVALID.
	<br>
	There is also the <a href="#FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID">FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID</a> variable which controls the same function globally, for the
	whole firewall.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>fragments</b>
	<br>Drops all packet fragments. Please note that most probably this rule will never match anything since
	iptables reconstructs all packets automatically, before the iptables firewall rules are processed, when its connection tracker is running.
	<br>I left this here for psychological reasons and in case some one finds some use for it.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>new-tcp-w/o-syn</b>
	<br>Drops all TCP packets that initiate a socket but have no the SYN bit set.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>syn-floods</b>
	<br>Allows only a certain amount of new TCP connections per second. The optional two arguments [requests/sec] and [burst]
	are used by this rule in order to provide control on the number of connections to be allowed.
	The default is 100 connections per second that can match 50 (it was 4 in v1.38 and before) packets initially
	(this is implemented using the <b>limit</b> module of iptables: see <b>man iptables</b> for more).
	<br>Note that this rule applies to all connections attempted regardless of their final result (rejected, dropped, established, etc).
	Therefore it might not be a good idea to set it too low.
	</ul>
	<ul><b>icmp-floods</b>
	<br>Allows only a certain amount of ICMP echo requests per second. The optional two arguments [requests/sec] and [burst]
	are used by this rule in order to provide control on the number of connections to be allowed.
	The default is 100 connections per second that can match 50 (it was 4 in v1.38 and before) packets initially
	(this is implemented using the <b>limit</b> module of iptables: see <b>man iptables</b> for more).
	</ul>
	<ul><b>all-floods</b>
	<br>Allows only a certain amount of new connections per second. The optional two arguments [requests/sec] and [burst]

	<a name="server"><h3><b>server</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	The <b>server</b> subcommand defines a server of a service. For FireHOL a server is the destination of a request,
	and even if this is more complex for multi-socket services, <u>for FireHOL a server always accepts requests</u>.
	<p>
	The optional rule parameters given to the parent primary command (interface or router) are inherited by the <b>server</b> as they have been given.
	<p>
	<br>This subcommand can be used on both interfaces and routers.
	<p>
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>service</b> is one of the supported service names.
			<br>The command accepts more than one services in the same argument if they are separated by space
			and quoted as a single argument.
			<br>Example 1: <b>server smtp accept</b>
			<br>Example 2: <b>server "smtp pop3 imap" accept</b>
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>action</b> tells FireHOL what to do with the traffic matching this rule.
			<p>FireHOL supports the actions defined in the section <a href="#actions">Actions</a>.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>
			
		<li>	<b>optional rule parameters</b> is a set of rules that allow further restriction of the traffic that
			gets matched by this rule. See <a href="#parameters">Optional Rules Parameters</a> for more information.

	<a name="client"><h3><b>client</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	The <b>client</b> subcommand defines a client of a service. For FireHOL a client is the source of a request.
	FireHOL follows this simple rule even on multi-socket complex protocols, so that <u>for FireHOL a client always sends requests</u>.
	<br>The parameters are exactly the same with the <a href="#server">server</a> subcommand.
	<p>
	The optional rule parameters given to the parent primary command (interface or router) are inherited by the <b>client</b>, but they are reversed.
	For an explanation of this please refer to the documentation of the <a href="#router">router</a> primary command.
	<p>
	<br>This subcommand can be used on both interfaces and routers.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="100%">
	
	<a name="route"><h3><b>route</b> <font color="red">&lt;service&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font> [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	The <b>route</b> subcommand is an alias for the <b>server</b> command that can be used only on routers, not interfaces.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="100%">
	
	<a name="group_cmd"><h3><b>group</b> with [optional rule parameters]</h3>
	<h3><b>group</b> end</h3></a>
	
	The <b>group</b> subcommand allows grouping for <a href="#server">server</a> and <a href="#client">client</a>
	subcommands that share common optional rule parameters.
	<p>
	There is only one reason for using groups: Optimization of the generated firewall rules.
	With groups, all the optional rule parameters are checked only once, while entering the
	group, and then each service is applied without extra processing.
	<p>
	For example:
<center><table border=0 cellpadding=15 cellspacing=20 width="70%">
<tr><td bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<b><pre>

	interface any world
		server http accept
		
		# trusted services
		group with src "1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8"
			server ssh	accept
			server telnet	accept
		group end
		
		client all accept
</pre></b>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
	The above will be optimal compared with <b>server "ssh telnet" accept src "1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8"</b>.
	<p>
	FireHOL supports nested groups.

<p>

	<a name="action"><h3><b>action</b> [chain <font color="red">&lt;name&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;action&gt;</font></h3></a>
	The <b>action</b> helper creates an iptables chain which can be used to control the action of other firewall rules during runtime.
	For example, you can setup the custom action ACT1, which by default is ACCEPT, but under certain cases it can be changed to DROP, REJECT or RETURN without
	restarting the firewall.
	<p>
	The first argument must always be the word <b>chain</b>, for the moment.
	<ul>
		<li><b>name</b> can be any chain name accepted by iptables. It is suggested to keep it between 5 to 10 letters.

	Example 1:
	<p>
	At the top of firehol.conf, create the action ACT1:
	<p>
	action chain ACT1 accept
	<p>
	later, in interfaces and routers, create rules that use the ACT1 action:
	<p>
	server smtp ACT1
	client imap ACT1
	<p>
	Please note that actions created this way are case sensitive.<br>
	At some point, and while the firewall is running, the action ACT1 can be changed to DROP, with this linux command (this is not FireHOL specific):
	<p>
	iptables -t filter -I ACT1 -j DROP
	<p>
	The above command inserts (-I) the new action DROP above the default action ACCEPT, and therefore all the traffic matching the FireHOL rules that have
	the action ACT1 will now be dropped.<br>
	To return to the default action (ACCEPT), run the following linux command:
	<p>
	iptables -t filter -D ACT1 -j DROP
	<p>
	This command deletes (-D) the DROP action that was inserted above the default action. If you delete all actions in the chain ACT1, the default action will be RETURN,
	in which case all rules with action ACT1 will be neutralized (it will be the same as they were not specified at all in firehol.conf).
	<p>
	Example 2: <b>action chain "ACT1 ACT2 ACT3" accept chain "ACT4 ACT5 ACT6" drop</b> # will create 6 actions, ACT1, ACT2, ACT3 with ACCEPT and ACT4, ACT5, ACT6 with DROP<br>

	<a name="blacklist"><h3><b>blacklist</b> [option] <font color="red">&lt;IPs&gt;</font></h3></a>
	The <b>blacklist</b> helper creates a blacklist for the <b>IP</b> addresses given. It supports two modes of operation
	based on the option given (or the absence of it).
	<p>
	The option can be:
	<ul>
		<li>one of the words <b>them, him, her, it, this, these, input</b> in which case it will generate a unidirectional
		statefull blacklist, meaning that you will be able to ask (initiate connections) anything from them,
		but they will not be able to ask (initiate connections) anything from you or the remote hosts you protect (routing).
		<br>&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>one of the words <b>all, full</b> or ommitted (no option given), in which case FireHOL will create bidirectional
		stateless rules that will DROP all traffic comming in from these IPs and will REJECT all traffic going to them.
		</li>
		<p>
	</ul>
	The blacklist helper affects both interfaces and routers and can be used as many times as needed, but before the first interface statement.
	The blacklist helper accepts multiple IPs both as one quoted and space separated list and as separate arguments.
	<p>
	
	Example 1: <b>blacklist this "195.97.5.202 10.1.1.1"</b> # please note the quotes<br>

	The <b>connmark</b> helper is used to set a mark on a whole connection in both directions of the traffic automatically. The difference with <a href="#mark">mark</a> is that the later just marks the packets matched by the optional rule parameters, while connmark marks the whole statefull connection.
	
	<H4>Parameters</H4>
	<ul>
		<li>	<b>VALUE</b> can be a mark value to set, or the words <b>save</b> to convert the existing mark of the packets to connmark, or <b>restore</b> to convert the existing connmark of the connection to a mark on the packets.
			<br>&nbsp;
			</li>

		<li>	<b>WHERE</b> tells FireHOL where to search for the specific traffic to be marked.
			<br>Currently, WHERE can be one of the build-in iptables chains attached to table <b>mangle</b>.

	<p>
	Example 1: Let's say that you have 3 ethernet interfaces: eth0, eth1 and eth2. eth0 connects you to the LAN, while eth1 and eth2 connect you to the internet via 2 different service providers.
	You want to guarrantee that when a connection is coming from provider 1 (eth1) will go back through this provider and the same for provider 2 (eth2).
	
	<p>	Step 1: You mark the connections when they enter the firewall host from the provider interfaces:
	<br>	connmark 1 PREROUTING inface eth1
	<br>	connmark 2 PREROUTING inface eth2
	
	<p>	Step 2: You restore the mark (from the connmark) when the packets come in from the LAN:
	<br>	connmark restore OUTPUT
	<br>	connmark restore PREROUTING inface eth0
	
	<p>	Now you can use iproute2 to pick the right routing table (eth1 or eth2 and the default gateway) based on the MARK of the packets.
	
	<br>
	<br>Example 2: <b>connmark 1 PREROUTING inface eth1</b>, Set the CONNMARK 1 to all packets coming in from eth1.
	<br>Example 3: <b>connmark save PREROUTING inface eth1</b>, Save the MARK value to the CONNMARK value on all packets coming in from eth1.

	The <b>iptables</b> command passes all its arguments to the real iptables command, during run-time.
	<p>
	You should not use in FireHOL configurations <b>/sbin/iptables</b> or other means to alter a FireHOL firewall.
	If you do, your commands will be run <u>before</u> FireHOL activates its firewall and while the <u>previous</u>
	firewall is still running. Also, since FireHOL will delete all <u>previous</u> firewall rules in order to
	activate the new firewall, any changes you will make, will be deleted too.

	<a name="mac"><h3><b>mac</b> <font color="red">&lt;IP&gt;</font> <font color="red">&lt;MAC&gt;</font></h3></a>
	The <b>mac</b> helper verifies that all traffic <b>comming in</b> with source the <b>IP</b> address, comes from the
	<b>MAC</b> address. The helper applies its rules to filter/INPUT and filter/FORWARD and checks the source IP address
	in combination with the source MAC address.
	<p>
	The same MAC address is allowed to use other IPs; only the specific IP is required to be used with the specified MAC

	<a name="masquerade"><h3><b>masquerade</b> [reverse | interface] [optional rule parameters]</h3></a>
	Masquerading is a special from of SNAT (Source NAT) that changes the source of requests when they go out and replaces their original source when replies come in.
	This way a Linux box can become an internet router for a LAN of clients having unroutable IP addresses. Masquerading takes care to re-map IP addresses and ports as
	required.
	<p>
	Masquerading is "expensive" compared to SNAT because it checks the IP address of the ougoing interface every time for every packet, and therefore it is suggested that
	if you connect to the internet with a static IP address, to prefer SNAT.
	<p>
	The <b>masquerade</b> helper sets up masquerading on the output of a network interface (not the <a href="#interface">interface</a> command, but a real network interface).
	<br>
	<br>If the <b>masquerade</b> command is placed within an <a href="#interface">interface</a> command, its network interface(s) will be used.
	<br>If the <b>masquerade</b> command is placed within a <a href="#router">router</a> command that has an <a href="#outface">outface</a> defined, then the <a href="#outface">outface</a> network interface(s) will be used.
	<br>If placed within a <a href="#router">router</a> command but the keyword <b>reverse</b> is specified and the <a href="#router">router</a> command has an <a href="#inface">inface</a> defined, then the <a href="#inface">inface</a> network interface(s) will be used.
	<br>If placed outside and before all <a href="#primary_commands">primary commands</a>, an interface (or list of space separated interfaces, within double quotes) can be specified on the <b>masquerade</b> command.
	<p>
	In all cases, <b>masquerade</b> will setup itself on the <b>output</b> of the given interface(s).
	<p>
	Please note that if <b>masquerade</b> is used within some <a href="#interface">interface</a> or <a href="#router">router</a>, it does not respect the optional rule parameters
	given to this interface or router command. <b>Masquerade</b> uses <u>only</u> its own <a href="#parameters">optional rule parameters</a>.
	<p>
	<a href="#inface">inface</a> and <a href="#outface">outface</a> should not be given as parameters to <b>masquerade</b> (inface because iptables does not support this
	in the POSTROUTING chain, and outface because it will be overwritten by the interface(s) mentioned above).
	<p>
	Finally, the <b>masquerade</b> helper will turn on <a href="#FIREHOL_NAT">FIREHOL_NAT</a> and instruct the kernel to do packet forwarding (like the <a href="#router">router</a>
	commands do).

		<b>target</b> accepts all <b>--to-source</b> values <b>iptables</b> accepts (see <b>iptables -j SNAT --help</b>).
		Multiple --to-source values can be given, if separated by space and quoted as a single argument.
		<p>
		<a href="#inface">inface</a> should not be used in SNAT, because iptables does not provide this information

		<p>
		<b>YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOURCE ADDRESS YOU SPECIFY IS SUCH THAT THE REPLIES WILL BE SEND BACK

		For the host doing the NAT, <b>real</b> is "where do I have to really send it?"
		<br>&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li><b>redirect-to</b>, to catch traffic comming in and send it to the local machine (created in NAT/PREROUTING).
		<br>The <b>target</b> in this case is a port or a range of ports (XXX-YYY) that packets matching the rule
		will be redirected to (if no optional rule parameters are given, all incomming traffic will be matched).
		<b>target</b> accepts all <b>--to-ports</b> values <b>iptables</b> accepts (see <b>iptables -j REDIRECT --help</b>).
		<p>
		<a href="#outface">outface</a> should not be used in REDIRECT, because iptables does not provide this information

	The <b>transparent_proxy</b> helper sets up trasparent proxy server for TCP traffic.
	The proxy is assumed to be running on the firewall host at port <b>port</b>, with the credentials of the local user <b>user</b> serving TCP port's <b>service</b> requests.
	<p>
	The <b>transparent_proxy</b> helper can be used for two kinds of traffic:
	<ul>
		<li>Incomming TCP traffic, either targeted to the firewall host or passing through the firewall host.
		<br>The optional rule parameters can be used to specify which kind of <b>incomming</b> traffic to be catched
		(by using <a href="#inface">inface</a>, <a href="#src">src</a>, <a href="#dst">dst</a>, etc --
		<a href="#outface">outface</a> should not be used here, because the rules generated are placed before
		the routing decision and therefore the outgoing interface is not yet known).
		<p>
		If no optional rule parameters are given, then the transparent
		proxy will be setup on <b>all network interfaces for all TCP traffic</b> (use this with care since you are
		risking to serve requests from the internet using your proxy).
		<br>&nbsp;
		</li>
		<li>Locally generated outgoing TCP traffic, except TCP traffic generated by processes running as the <b>user</b> argument.
		The optional rule parameters <a href="#inface">inface</a>, <a href="#outface">outface</a> and <a href="#src">src</a> are
		ignored for this type of traffic.
		<p>
		This kind of matching makes it possible to support transparent proxying for clients running on the firewall
		host, as far as they do not run as the user excluded. More than one users can be specified by space-separating
		and enclosing them in double quotes.
		<p>
		This rule can be disabled by specifing as user the empty string: <b>""</b>
		<br>&nbsp;
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Of course, make sure that your firewall allows requests to reach your proxy server.
	<p>
	In kernel versions prior to 2.6 you need to enable CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL for locally generated outgoing traffic to be redirected correctly.
	<p>
	Example 1: <b>transparent_proxy 80 3128 squid inface eth0 src 10.0.0.0/8</b> to redirect all tcp/80 requests coming in from eth0 (10.0.0.0/8) to your local web caching proxy server listening at port 3128 and running as user squid.
	<br>Example 2: <b>transparent_proxy "80 3128 8080" 8080 "squid privoxy root bin" inface not "ppp+ ipsec+" dst not "a.not.proxied.server"</b>
	to redirect all web and proxy requests (tcp: 80, 3128, 8080) coming in from all interfaces except ppp+ and ipsec+ to your local squid server listening at tcp/8080 except those requests generated by the local users squid, privoxy, root and bin, and all matching traffic that is targeting host 'a.not.proxied.server'.

	The <b>version</b> command states the FireHOL <u>release</u> the configuration file was
	created for. In case the configuration file is newer than FireHOL, FireHOL will deny
	to run it.
	<p>
	This command is here to allow you or anyone else design and distribute FireHOL configuration files, while
	ensuring that the correct FireHOL version is going to run them.
	<p>
	Since FireHOL configurations are BASH script, it is relatively easy to use FireHOL configurations as small
	scripts that dynamically process rules stored in a database, in a file system as separate files, or elsewhere.
	This directive will help the developers of FireHOL configurations to control the required version of
	FireHOL.
	<p>
	The FireHOL release is increased every time the format of the configuration file and the internals of FireHOL are changed.
	<p>
	Since FireHOL v1.67 <b>version</b> is not required to be present in every configuration file.

<table border=0 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0 width="100%"><tr bgcolor="#777777"><td align=center><font color="white"><b><big><a name="actions">Actions</a></td</tr></table>
<small>
Actions are the actions to be taken on services and traffic described by other commands and functions.
Please note that normally, FireHOL will pass-through to the generated iptables statements all the possible actions iptables accepts, but only the ones defined here can be used
with lower case letters and currently it will be impossible to pass arguments to some unknown action. Also, keep in mind that the iptables action LOG is a FireHOL optional rule
parameter (see <a href="#log">log</a> and <a href="#loglimit">loglimit</a>) that can be defined together with one of the following actions and FireHOL will actually produce
multiple iptables statements to achieve both the logging and the action.
</small>
<p>

	<a name="accept"><h3><b>accept</b> [with limit &lt;frequency&gt; &lt;burst&gt; [overflow &lt;action&gt;]]</h3></a>
	<h3><b>accept</b> [with knock &lt;name&gt;]</h3>
	<h3><b>accept</b> [with recent &lt;name&gt; &lt;seconds&gt; &lt;hits&gt;]</h3>
	<b>accept</b> allows the traffic matching the rules to reach its destination.
	<p>
	<b>with limit</b><br>
	The optional parameter <b>with limit</b> offers control over the allowed frequency of NEW connections. <b>frequency</b> and <b>burst</b> have the same syntax of the <a href="#limit">limit</a>
	optional rule parameter.
	<p>
	The overflow <b>action</b> offers control over the overflowed NEW connections. The default is to REJECT overflowed connections (not DROP them, since DROP produces timeouts
	on the otherwise valid service clients). Also, the REJECT overflow action, will reject TCP connections with <b>tcp-reset</b> and all others with <b>icmp-host-unreachable</b>.
	<br>
	The overflowed NEW connection attempts will be logged with a <b>OVERFLOW</b> message, with the options the <a href="#loglimit">loglimit</a> parameter works.
	<p>
	<b>with knock</b><br>
	The optional parameter <b>with knock</b> allows easy integration with <a href="http://www.zeroflux.org/knock/">knockd</a>, a server that allows you to control access to services, by sending certain packets to "knock" the
	door, before the door is open for service.<br>
	This parameter accepts just a name. This name is used to build a special chain <b>knock_&lt;name&gt;</b> which will contain just the rules to allow established connections to work,
	but it prevent any new connections from taking place. In case, knockd has not allowed new connections, this traffic entering this chain will just return back
	and continue to match against the other rules until the end of the firewall.
	<p>
	How to use it: lets say that you want to allow https traffic based on a knock. In FireHOL you write:
	<p>
	<pre>server https accept with knock hidden</pre>
	<p>
	and you configure knockd so that it runs:
	<p>
	<pre>iptables -A knock_hidden -s %IP% -j ACCEPT</pre>
	<p>
	to enable the https service (notice that there is no need to match anything else than the IP. FireHOL already matches everything needed for its rules to work), and:
	<p>
	<pre>iptables -D knock_hidden -s %IP% -j ACCEPT</pre>
	<p>
	to disable this service for the given IP.
	<p>
	You can use the same knock name in more than one FireHOL services to enable/disable all the services together, without any extra effort in knockd configuration (just one ACCEPT row like above
	- i.e. the same knock as far as knockd is concerned - will allow all the FireHOL services with the same knock name to serve requests for the given IP).
	Check also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1199404&forum_id=196547">this forum post</a>.
	<p>
	<p>
	<b>with recent</b><br>
	The optional parameter <b>with recent</b> allows new connections to be limited per remote IP for a number of seconds and/or hits.
	The name parameter allows multiple statements to share the same recent list of IPs.
	If the time or the hits are not required, set them to empty.
	Keep in mind that when a new connection is not allowed, the traffic will continue to be matched by the rest of the firewall. In other words, if the traffic is not allowed due to the limitations set here, it is not dropped. It is just not matched by this rule.
	<p>
	Example 1: <b>server smtp accept</b>, to allow SMTP requests and their replies to flow.<br>
	Example 2: <b>server smtp accept with limit 10/s 100</b>, to allow SMTP requests to come at 10/second max, with a burst of 100, and their replies to flow back.<br>
	Example 3: <b>server smtp accept with limit 10/s 100 overflow drop</b>, to allow SMTP requests to come at 10/second max, with a burst of 100, and their replies to flow back. The overflow requests will be dropped.<br>
	Example 4: <b>server smtp accept with limit 10/s 100 src "1.2.3.4 5.6.7.8"</b>, same as example 2, but the only valid clients are given as argument to <b>src</b>
	Example 4: <b>server smtp accept with recent mail 60 2</b>, to allow only 2 connections every 60 seconds per remote IP, to the smtp server.
	<p>

<hr noshade size=1 width="100%">

	<a name="reject"><h3><b>reject</b> [with &lt;message&gt;]</h3></a>
	<b>reject</b> discards the matching traffic but sends a rejecting message back to the sender.
	<p>
	<b>with</b> is used to offer control on the message to be returned to the sender.
	<b>with</b> accepts all the arguments the <b>--reject-with</b> iptables expression accepts. For an updated list
	of these messages type <b>iptables -j REJECT --help</b>. Bellow you can find the list my system accepts.
	<p>
	By default (no <b>with</b> argument given), <b>reject</b> will send an <b>icmp-port-unreachable</b> on all protocols
	except TCP, for which it will send a <b>tcp-reset</b>.

The parameters described bellow are all that FireHOL supports. You should check the documentation of each command to find which parameters should not be used with it.
Normally, all FireHOL commands are designed so that if you specify a parameters that is also used internally, the internal one will overwrite the one given in the configuration file. In such a case,
FireHOL will present you a warning with the old and the new value.<p>
Not all parameters should be used in all cases. For example <a href="#sport">sport</a> and <a href="#dport">dport</a> should not be used in normal <a href="#server">server</a> and

	<a name="log"><h3><b>log</b> <font color="red">"&lt;some text&gt;"</font> [<b>level</b> a_level]</h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	<b>log</b> will log the matching packets to syslog. Note that this is not an action (in iptables it is).
	FireHOL will actually produce multiple iptables commands to accomplish both the action for the rule and the logging.
	You can control how logging works, by altering the variables <a href="#FIREHOL_LOG_MODE">FIREHOL_LOG_MODE</a>, <a href="#FIREHOL_LOG_OPTIONS">FIREHOL_LOG_OPTIONS</a> and
	<a href="#FIREHOL_LOG_LEVEL">FIREHOL_LOG_LEVEL</a>. You can also change the level of just one rule by using the
	<b>level</b> argument of the <b>log</b> parameter (only when FIREHOL_LOG_MODE=LOG).
	<p>
	FireHOL logs traffic, exactly the same way iptables does. Many users have complained about packet logs appearing at
	their console. To avoid this you will have to:
	<ul>
		<li>setup <b>klogd</b> to log only more important traffic</li>
		<li>change <a href="#FIREHOL_LOG_LEVEL">FIREHOL_LOG_LEVEL</a> to log at a not so important log-level</li>
	</ul>
	Actually <b>klogd</b>'s -c option and <b>iptables</b>' --log-level option are the same thing (iptables accepts also
	the numeric values klogd accepts). If iptables logs at a
	higher priority than klogd is configured to use, then your packets will appear in the console too.
	<p>
	In most kernels klogd is by default configured to log everything, so if you don't also change <b>klogd</b>'s -c option,
	the --log-level setting of iptables has no effect. Use the table bellow to match klogd options with --log-level options:

	To prevent packet logs appearing to the console, <b>klogd</b> option must be LOWER than the one iptables uses.
	<p>
	On <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a> systems, you can configure <b>klogd</b> by changing

	<a name="mac_param"><h3><b>mac</b> [not] <font color="red">&lt;address&gt;</font></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	<b>mac</b> matches the source MAC address of packets comming into the firewall. The mac parameter does nothing for outgoing traffic.
	<br>
	For interfaces, the mac parameter matches against all traffic that comes into the firewall, whether it is <a href="#server">server</a>
	or <a href="#client">client</a> traffic.
	<br>
	For routers, the mac parameter matches also against all traffic comming into the firewall, but firehol considers the router
	input differently based on the command given. For <a href="#server">server</a> or <a href="#route">route</a> statements,
	the mac parameter matches the MAC address of the client (the host sending the request),
	while for <a href="#client">client</a> statements it matches the source MAC address of the server (the host accepting requests).
	<p>
	In principle, the mac parameter behaves the same for both interfaces and routers and this is why:
	The mac parameter matches the source MAC address of what FireHOL considers the "remote" host, not the one that FireHOL considers the "protected" one.
	For interfaces, this is simple, because always the "remote" host is a remote host and the "protected" host is the one running the
	firewall. For routers though, the command chosen (client or server) defines what the firewall protects. Therefore, a client statement
	protects the client making the "remote" host the server, while a server statement protects the server and therefore the "remote"
	host is the client.
	<p>
	More than one MAC addresses can be given if separated by spaces and enclosed in quotes as a single argument to the mac parameter.
	<p>
	The <b>not</b> argument will reverse the match. In case there are many MAC addresses defined, positive expressions are ORed
	(either address should be matched), while negative expressions are ANDed (none of the addresses should be matched).

	<a name="FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE"><h3><b>FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE controls the file that will be created when FireHOL is called with the <b>save</b> command line argument.
	If this variable is empty (the default), FireHOL will try to detect where to save the file. Currently, the RedHat way
	(/etc/sysconfig/iptables) and the Debian way (/var/lib/iptables/autosave) are automatically detected (in the order given here)
	based on the existance of the directory this file should be created in.
	<p>
	Default: <b>FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE=""</b>
	<br>
	Example: <b>FIREHOL_AUTOSAVE="/tmp/firehol-saved.txt"</b>

	<a name="FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES"><h3><b>FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES controls the way FireHOL handles required kernel modules.
	If set to 0 (zero), FireHOL will not attempt to load kernel modules at all. Set this to 0 (zero)
	if you have compiled a kernel that has all the modules build into it.
	<p>
	Since v1.165 of the FireHOL this feature is almost useless.
	FireHOL now tries to find the .config file of your kernel
	(in <b>/proc/config</b> or <b>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/.config</b>
	or <b>/usr/src/linux/.config</b>, in this order) and figures out which kernel modules are compiled
	build-in and which are modules.
	<br>
	So, this variable is only used in cases where FireHOL has no access at all to kernel configuration.
	<p>
	Keep in mind, that FireHOL is able to detect the <b>ip_tables</b> and <b>ip_conntrack</b> modules
	by examining the relative entries in /proc, so it can detect whether these are loaded without the
	need for the kernel configuration.
	<p>
	Default: <b>FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES=1</b>
	<br>
	Example: <b>FIREHOL_LOAD_KERNEL_MODULES=0</b>

	<a name="FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK"><h3><b>FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK allows you to choose if FireHOL will trust the <b>lo</b> interface and
	accept all traffic to or from it (although not FORWARD, it matches only INPUT and OUTPUT).
	<p>
	The default is to accept all traffic from/to <b>lo</b>. If however you need to control what
	the local system users can use on the local machine, you can set this to anything other than 1
	allowing you to setup the firewall as you will.
	<p>
	<b>IMPORTANT: If you choose not to trust interface lo and you don't specifically setup the lo
	interface in firehol.conf, no local process will be able to communicate to any other local process,
	which most likely will break several things. Be sure you know what you are doing.</b>
	<p>
	This option appeared in FireHOL version 1.195.
	<p>
	Default: <b>FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK=1</b>
	<br>
	Example: <b>FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK=0</b>

	<a name="FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN"><h3><b>FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN allows you to choose if FireHOL will drop all TCP connections
	with ACK FIN set without logging them.
	In busy environments the iptables connection tracker removes from the connection tracking list
	entries when it receives a FIN. This makes the ACK FIN appear as an invalid packet (it does not
	match anything on the connection tracking list, and it is not a new connection).
	Normally FireHOL logs this traffic. If FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN is set to 1, FireHOL
	will silentrly drop such packets.
	<p>
	Default: <b>FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN=0</b>
	<br>
	Example: <b>FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN=1</b>

	<a name="RESERVED_IPS"><h3><b>RESERVED_IPS</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	This variable includes all the IP addresses defined as <b>IANA - Reserved</b> by <a href="http://www.iana.org">IANA</a>.
	You can overwrite the internal default definion of this variable by creating a file with same name in /etc/firehol.
	This file accepts an IP definition per line.
	The supplied <b>get-iana.sh</b> script creates this file by directly fetching <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space">this</a> document.
	<p>
	Example: <b>interface eth0 internet src not "${RESERVED_IPS}"</b>

	<a name="PRIVATE_IPS"><h3><b>PRIVATE_IPS</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	This variable includes all the IP addresses defined as <b>Private</b> or <b>Test</b> by <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt?number=3330">RFC 3330</a>.
	You can overwrite the internal default definion of this variable by creating a file with same name in /etc/firehol.
	This file accepts an IP definition per line.
	<p>

	<a name="UNROUTABLE_IPS"><h3><b>UNROUTABLE_IPS</b></h3></a>
	<H4>Description</H4>
	This variable is both RESERVED_IPS and PRIVATE_IPS together. I suggest to use this variable on interfaces and routers
	accepting Internet traffic.
	You can overwrite the internal default definion of this variable by creating a file with same name in /etc/firehol.
	This file accepts an IP definition per line.
	<p>
	Example: <b>interface eth0 internet src not "${UNROUTABLE_IPS}"</b>
