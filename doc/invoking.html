Home for FireHOL, an iptables stateful packet filtering firewall builder for Linux (kernel 2.4),
supporting NAT, SNAT, DNAT, REDIRECT, MASQUERADE, DMZ, dual-homed, multi-homed and router setups,
protecting and securing hosts and LANs in all kinds of topologies. Configuration is done using
simple client and server statements while it can detect (and produce) its configuration
automatically. FireHOL is extremely easy to understand, configure and audit.

FireHOL has been designed to be a startup service. As such, FireHOL accepts all the command line arguments
/etc/init.d/iptables plus a few more. Bellow is a list of the currently supported command line arguments:
<p>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=5 width="70%">
<tr><th bgcolor="#000000"><font color="white">Parameter</th><th bgcolor="#000000"><font color="white">Description</th></tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top><b>start</td>
	<td>	Activates the firewall configuration.
		<br>The configuration is expected to be found in <b>/etc/firehol/firehol.conf</b>
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>try</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Activates the firewall, but waits until
		the user types the word <b>commit</b>. If this word
		is not typed within 30 seconds, the previous
		firewall is restored.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top><b>stop</td>
	<td>	Stops a running iptables firewall.
		This will allow all traffic to pass unchecked.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>restart</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	this is an alias for <b>start</b> and is given for
		compatibility with <b>/etc/init.d/iptables</b>.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top><b>condrestart</td>
	<td>	Starts the FireHOL firewall only if it is not
		already active. It does not detect a modified
		configuration file, only verifies that FireHOL has been started
		in the past and not stopped yet.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>status</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Shows the running firewall, as in
		<b>/sbin/iptables -nxvL | less</b>
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top><b>panic</td>
	<td>	It removes all rules from the running firewall and then it DROPs all
	traffic on all iptables tables (mangle, nat, filter) and pre-defined chains
	(PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING), thus blocking all IP
	communication. DROPing is not done by changing the default policy to DROP, but
	by adding just one rule per table/chain to drop all traffic, because the default
	iptables scripts supplied by many systems (including RedHat 8) do not reset
	all the chains to ACCEPT when starting (FireHOL resets them correctly).
	<p>
	When activating panic mode, FireHOL checks for the existance of the SSH_CLIENT shell
	environment variable (set by SSH). If it find this, then panic mode will allow the established
	SSH connection specified in this variable to operate. Notice that in order for this
	to work, you should have <b>su</b> without the minus (-) sign, since <b>su -</b>
	overwrites the shell variables and therefore the SSH_CLIENT variable is lost.
	<p>
	Alternativelly, after the <b>panic</b> argument you can specify an IP address
	in which case all <u>established</u> connections between this IP address and the host
	in panic will be allowed.
	</td>
	</tr>
<tr>	<td valign=top bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>save</td>
	<td bgcolor="#EEEEEE">	Start the firewall and then save it using
		<b>/sbin/iptables-save</b> to <b>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</b>.
		<p>
		Since v1.64, this is not implemented using <b>/etc/init.d/iptables save</b>
		because there is a bug in some versions of iptables-save that save
		invalid commands
		(<b>! --uid-owner A</b> is saved as <b>--uid-owner !A</b>) which
		cannot be restored. FireHOL fixes this problem (by saving it, and
		then replacing <b>--uid-owner !</b> with <b>! --uid-owner </b>).
		<p>
		Note that not all FireHOL firewalls will work if
		restored with: <b>/etc/init.d/iptables start</b>
		because FireHOL handles kernel modules and might have queried
		RPC servers (used by the NFS service) before starting the firewall.
		Also, FireHOL automatically checks current kernel configuration for
		client ports range. If you restore a firewall using the iptables service
		your firewall may not work as expected.
		<p>
		Since v1.258 FireHOL also saves the required kernel modules in an
		executable shell script in /var/spool/firehol/last_save_modules.sh.
		This script can be called during boot to restore the required kernel
		modules for the firewall saved using this command.

<p>
Since version 1.45 of FireHOL, configuration files can accept command line arguments. These commands line
arguments are given to FireHOL which passes them to the configuration file.
All the above FireHOL parameters support this feature. To activate it, add a double dash (--) as the
command line argument to FireHOL and then just give parameters to be passed to the configuration file.
<p>
<table border=0 cellpadding=10 cellspacing=0 width="100%">
<tr><td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><b>What happens when FireHOL runs?</td></tr></table>
<br>

FireHOL is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> script.
To run its configuration file, FireHOL
first defines a set of functions and variables and then it &quot;sources&quot; 
(runs inline) its configuration file to be executed by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a>.</p>
<p>
The keywords <b>interface</b>, <b>client</b>, <b>server</b>, <b>
router</b>, etc. are all <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> functions that are executed by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">BASH</a> when 
and if they appear in the configuration file. Using shared variables 
these functions share some state information that allows them to know, 
for example, that a <b>client</b> command appears within an <b>interface</b> 
and not within a <b>router</b> and that the name given to an <b>
interface</b> has not been used before.
<p>
Instead of running iptables commands directly, each of these 
functions (i.e. FireHOL) just writes the generated iptables commands to 
a temporary file. This is done to prevent altering a running firewall 
before ensuring that the syntax of the configuration file is correct. 
So, a complete run of the configuration file actually produces all the 
iptables commands for the firewall, written to a temporary file 
(script).&nbsp; Even the <b>iptables</b> commands given within the 
configuration file use the same concept (they just generate iptables 
commands in this script).
<p>
Finally, this script (the generated iptables commands) has to be run, 
but before doing so, FireHOL saves the running firewall to another 
temporary file. The saved firewall will be automatically restored if 
some of the generated iptables commands produces an error.
Such an error 
is possible when for example, you specify an invalid IP address or 
hostname, or an invalid argument to some&nbsp; parameter that gets passed to 
iptables as-is.
<p>
It is important to understand that <b>during the run of the generated 
iptables script (including the possible restoration of the old 
firewall), FireHOL allows all traffic to reach its destination</b>. This 
has been done to prevent a possible lock-out situation where you are 
SSHing to the server to alter its firewall, and suddenly you loose the 
connection (although this can still happen if your new firewall doesn't 
allow the connection).
<p>
If no error has been seen, FireHOL deletes all temporary files 
generated and exits.
<p>
In case there was an error, FireHOL will make the most to restore 
your previous firewall and will present you details about the error and 
its line number in the original configuration file.
