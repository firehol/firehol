	NAME APC UPS Daemon
	HOME  http://www.apcupsd.com
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apcupsd
	EXAMPLE
		server apcupsd accept
	NOTES
		This service must be defined as "server apcupsd accept" on
		all machines not directly connected to the UPS (i.e. slaves).
		-
		Note that the port defined here is not the default port (6666)
		used if you download and compile APCUPSD, since the default
		conflicts with IRC and many distributions (like Debian) have
		changed this to 6544.
		-
		You can define port 6544 in APCUPSD, by changing the value
		of NETPORT in its configuration file, or overwrite this
		FireHOL service definition using the procedures described
		in [Adding Services](#adding-services)
		in [firehol.conf(5)](#firehol.conf5).

	NOTES
		The full syntax is:
		-
		*subcommand* `custom` *name* *svr-proto/ports* *cli-ports* *action* *params*
		-
		This service is used by FireHOL to allow you create rules
		for services which do not have a definition.
		-
		`subcommand`, *action* and *params* have their usual meanings.
		-
		A *name* must be supplied along with server
		ports in the form *proto/range*
		and client ports which takes only a
		*range*.

SERVICE dcpp
	NAME Direct Connect++ P2P
	HOME  http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net
	EXAMPLE
		server dcpp accept

SERVICE dhcp
	NAME Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhcp
	CPORT 68
	SPORT udp/67
	EXAMPLE
		server dhcp accept
	NOTES
		The dhcp service is implemented as stateless rules.
		-
		DHCP clients broadcast to the network (src 0.0.0.0
		dst 255.255.255.255) to find a DHCP server. If the DHCP
		service was stateful the iptables connection tracker would
		not match the packets and deny to send the reply.
		-
		Note that this change does not affect the security of either
		DHCP servers or clients, since only the specific ports are
		allowed (there is no random port at either the server or the
		client side).
		-
		Note also that the "server dhcp accept" or "client dhcp accept"
		commands should placed within interfaces that do not
		have src and / or dst defined (because of the initial
		broadcast).
		-
		You can overcome this problem by placing the DHCP service on
		a separate interface, without a src or dst but with a policy
		return. Place this interface before the one that defines the
		rest of the services.
		-
		For example:
		-
		`interface eth0 dhcp`
		-
		`    policy return`
		-
		`    server dhcp accept`
		-
		-
		`interface eth0 lan src "$mylan" dst "$myip"`
		-
		`    client all accept`
		-
		For example:
		    interface eth0 dhcp
		      policy return
		      server dhcp accept
		    interface eth0 lan src "$mylan" dst "$myip"
		      client all accept
		-
		This service implicitly sets its client or server to ipv4 mode.
SERVICE dhcprelay
	NAME DHCP Relay
	EXAMPLE
		server dhcprelay accept
	WIKI http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol#DHCP_relaying
	NOTES
		From RFC 1812 section 9.1.2:
		-
		In many cases, BOOTP clients and their associated BOOTP
		server(s) do not reside on the same IP (sub)network. In
		such cases, a third-party agent is required to transfer
		BOOTP messages between clients and servers. Such an agent
		was originally referred to as a BOOTP forwarding agent.
		However, to avoid confusion with the IP forwarding function
		of a router, the name BOOTP relay agent has been adopted
		instead.
		-
		For more information about DHCP Relay see section 9.1.2 of
		[RFC 1812](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1812.txt)
		and section 4 of
		[RFC 1542](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1542.txt)

SERVICE dhcpv6
	NAME Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6
	WIKI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCPv6
	CPORT udp/546
	SPORT udp/547
	EXAMPLE
		server dhcp accept
		client dhcp accept
	NOTES
		The dhcp service is implemented as stateless rules.
		It cannon be stateful as the connection tracker will not
		match a unicast reply to a broadcast request. Further,
		if you wish to add src/dst rule parameters, you must
		account for both the broadcast and link-local network prefixes.
		-
		Clients broadcast from a link-local address to the
		multicast address ff02::1:2 on UDP port 547 to find a
		server. The server sends a unicast reply back to the
		client which listens on UDP port 546.
		-
		For a FireHOL interface, creating a client will allow
		sending to port 547 and receiving on port 546. Creating
		a server allows sending to port 546 and receiving on port 547.
		-
		Unlike DHCP for IPv4, the source ports to be used are not
		defined in DHCPv6 - see section 5.2 of
		[RFC3315](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3315.txt).
		Some servers are known to make use of this to send from
		arbitrary ports, so FireHOL does not assume a source port.
		-
		This service implicitly sets its client or server to ipv6 mode.

SERVICE dict
	NAME Dictionary Server Protocol
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICT

SERVICE dns
	NAME Domain Name System
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System
	EXAMPLE
		server dns accept
	NOTES
		On very busy DNS servers you may see a few dropped DNS
		packets in your logs. This is normal. The iptables
		connection tracker will timeout the session and lose
		unmatched DNS packets that arrive too late to be useful.

SERVICE echo
	NAME Echo Protocol
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_Protocol

	NOTES
		According to
		[eMule Port Definitions](http://www.emule-project.net/home/perl/help.cgi?l=1&rm=show_topic&topic_id=122),
		FireHOL defines:
		-
		* Accept from any client port to the server at tcp/4661

SERVICE ipv6error
	NAME ICMPv6 Error Handling
	EXAMPLE
		server ipv6error accept
	NOTES
		Not all icmpv6 error types should be treated equally
		inbound and outbound.
		-
		The ipv6error rule wraps all of them in the following way:
		* allow incoming messages only for existing sessions
		* allow outgoing messages always
		-
		The following ICMPv6 messages are handled:
		-
		* destination-unreachable
		* packet-too-big
		* ttl-zero-during-transit
		* ttl-zero-during-reassembly
		* unknown-header-type
		* unknown-option
		-
		Interfaces should always have this set:
		-
		    `server ipv6error accept`
		-
		In a router with inface being internal and outface being
		external the following will meet the recommendations of
		[RFC 4890](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4890):
		-
		    `server ipv6error accept`
		-
		Do not use:
		    `client ipv6error accept`
		unless you are controlling traffic on a router interface
		where outface is the internal destination.
		-
		This service implicitly sets its client or server to ipv6 mode.

SERVICE ipv6neigh
	NAME IPv6 Neighbour discovery
	WIKI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol
	EXAMPLE
		client ipv6neigh accept
		server ipv6neigh accept
	NOTES
		IPv6 uses the Neighbour Discovery Protocol to do automatic
		configuration of routes and to replace ARP. To allow this
		functionality the network neighbour and router
		solicitation/advertisement messages should be enabled on
		each interface.
		-
		These rules are stateless since advertisement can happen
		automatically as well as on solicitation.
		-
		Neighbour discovery (incoming) should always be enabled:
		-
		    `server ipv6neigh accept`
		-
		Neighbour advertisement (outgoing) should always be enabled:
		-
		    `client ipv6neigh accept`
		-
		The rules should not be used to pass packets across a
		firewall (e.g. in a router definition) unless the firewall
		is for a bridge.
		-
		This service implicitly sets its client or server to ipv6 mode.

SERVICE ipv6router
	NAME IPv6 Router discovery

SERVICE microsoft_ds
	NAME Direct Hosted (NETBIOS-less) SMB
	ALIAS ms_ds
	EXAMPLE

	NOTES
		Direct Hosted (i.e. NETBIOS-less SMB)
		-
		This is another NETBIOS Session Service with minor
		differences with [netbios_ssn][keyword-service-netbios_ssn].
		It is supported only by Windows 2000 and Windows XP and
		it offers the advantage of being independent of WINS for
		name resolution.
		-
		It seems that samba supports transparently this protocol
		on the [netbios_ssn][keyword-service-netbios_ssn] ports, so

SERVICE netbios_ssn
	NAME NETBIOS Session Service
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbios#Session_service
	EXAMPLE
		server netbios_ssn accept
	NOTES
		See also the [samba][keyword-service-samba].
		-
		Please keep in mind that newer NETBIOS clients prefer to use
		port 445 ([microsoft_ds][keyword-service-microsoft_ds]) for the
		NETBIOS session service, and when this is not available they
		fall back to port 139 (netbios_ssn). Versions of samba above
		3.x bind automatically to ports 139 and 445.
		-
		If you have an older samba version and your policy on an
		interface or router is DROP, clients trying to access port
		445 will have to timeout before falling back to port 139.
		This timeout can be up to several minutes.
		-
		To overcome this problem you can explicitly REJECT the
		[microsoft_ds][keyword-service-microsoft_ds] with a
		tcp-reset message:
		-
		server microsoft_ds reject with tcp-reset

SERVICE nfs
	NAME Network File System
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29
	SPORT many
	EXAMPLE
		client nfs accept dst 192.0.2.1
	NOTES
		The NFS service queries the RPC service on the NFS server
		host to find out the ports nfsd, mountd, lockd and rquotad
		are listening. Then, according to these ports it sets up
		rules on all the supported protocols (as reported by RPC)
		in order the clients to be able to reach the server.
		-
		For this reason, the NFS service requires that:
		-
		* the firewall is restarted if the NFS server is restarted
		* the NFS server must be specified on all nfs statements (only if it is not the localhost)
		-
		Since NFS queries the remote RPC server, it is required to
		also be allowed to do so, by allowing the
		[portmap][keyword-service-portmap] too. Take care that
		this is allowed by the running firewall when FireHOL tries
		to query the RPC server. So you might have to setup NFS in
		two steps: First add the portmap service and activate the
		firewall, then add the NFS service and restart the firewall.
		-
		To avoid this you can setup your NFS server to listen on
		pre-defined ports, as documented in
		[NFS Howto][NFS Howto].
		If you do this then you will have to define the the ports
		using the procedure described
		in [Adding Services](#adding-services)
		in [firehol.conf(5)](#firehol.conf5).

		Then, according to these ports it sets up rules on all the

		For this reason, the nis service requires that:

		firewall, then add the nis service and restart the firewall.
		-
		This service was added to FireHOL by
		[Carlos Rodrigues](http://sourceforge.net/p/firehol/feature-requests/20).
		His comments regarding this implementation, are:
		-
		These rules work for client access only!
		-
		Pushing changes to slave servers won't work if these rules
		are active somewhere between the master and its slaves,
		because it is impossible to predict the ports where yppush
		will be listening on each push.
		-
		Pulling changes directly on the slaves will work, and could
		be improved performance-wise if these rules are modified to
		open fypxfrd. This wasn't done because it doesn't make that
		much sense since pushing changes on the master server is
		the most common, and recommended, way to replicate maps.

		server samba accept
	NOTES
		The samba service automatically sets all the rules for

		-
		Please refer to the notes of the above services for more
		information.
		-
		NETBIOS initiates based on the broadcast address of an
		interface (request goes to broadcast address) but the server
		responds from its own IP address. This makes the
		"server samba accept" statement drop the server reply,
		because of the way the iptables connection tracker works.
		-
		This service definition includes a hack, that allows a
		Linux samba server to respond correctly in such situations,
		by allowing new outgoing connections from the well known
		[netbios_ns][keyword-service-netbios_ns] port to the clients
		high ports.
		-
		However, for clients and routers this hack is not applied
		because it would open all unprivileged ports to the samba
		server. The only solution to overcome the problem in such
		cases (routers or clients) is to build a trust relationship
		between the samba servers and clients.
