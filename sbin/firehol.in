# FireHOL config directory.
# EVEN IF YOU CHANGE THIS, THE firehol-defaults.conf FILE
# SHOULD STILL EXIST IN THE ORIGINAL $FIREHOL_CONFIG_DIR
FIREHOL_CONFIG_DIR="$FIREHOL_CONFIG_DIR"

# FireHOL services directory.
# FireHOL will look into this directory for service
# definition files (*.conf).
# Package maintainers may install their service definitions
# in this directory.
# Default: /etc/firehol/services
FIREHOL_SERVICES_DIR="${FIREHOL_CONFIG_DIR}/services"

# Where to permanently save state information?
# Default: /var/spool/firehol
FIREHOL_SPOOL_DIR="/var/spool/firehol"

# Where temporary files should go?
# /var/run is usualy a ram drive, so we prefer to use
# this for temporary files.
# Default: /var/run/firehol
FIREHOL_RUN_DIR="/var/run/firehol"

# show a spinner during processing that shows
# number of iptables statements generated
FIREHOL_ENABLE_SPINNER=${FIREHOL_ENABLE_SPINNER-0}

# Restore instead of Start when possible.
# If set to 1, FireHOL will actually do a 'restore' when a
# 'start' is requested.
# If enabled and the config files have not changed since
# the last successful activation, the last successfuly
# activated firewall will be restored.
# THIS OPTION SHOULD NOT BE ENABLED IF THE FIREWALL CONFIG
# IS USING DYNAMIC DETECTION OF SERVER PORTS OR OTHER DATA
# THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE GENERATED RULES.
# At the other hand, if the firewall is always static
# this option provides fast startup of the firewall.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# RUNTIME CONTROL VARIABLES

# These do not affect the final firewall output. They just control how
# FireHOL behaves.
# They can also be set as environment variables of the same name.

# If set to 1, FireHOL will attempt to activate the firewall with
# iptables-restore. This is a lot faster firewall activation.
# The only drawback of this, is that in case of error, FireHOL may be unable to
# identify the exact statement in the firewall config that caused the error.
# Default: 1

# Only when FIREHOL_FAST_ACTIVATION=1, this value is the time in seconds, to
# wait for just an ENTER before trying the new firewall.
FIREHOL_WAIT_USER_BEFORE_TRY=600

# If set to 0, firehol will not try to load the required kernel modules
# Generally, FireHOL is able to detect if a module is compiled in the kernel,
# even if this is set to 1.
# Default: 1

# Default: 1
FIREHOL_ESTABLISHED_ACTIVATION_ACCEPT="${FIREHOL_ESTABLISHED_ACTIVATION_ACCEPT-1}"

# If you want to restore the firewall using the iptables init script of

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# FIREWALL CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

# These affect the final firewall output.
# They can also be set in the firewall config file.

# This controls how 'optimal' or 'accurate' the iptables statements
# generated will be.
# 'optimal' generates a production state firewall optimized for speed.
# It makes FireHOL accept all packets of ESTABLISHED connections at the
# beginning of the firewall, thus practically eliminating the need for
# filtering ESTABLISHED traffic. Packet filtering is only done for NEW
# sockets.
# 'accurate' generates a firewall that precisely matches all packets in both
# directions: client->server and server->client
# This setting affects logging, accounting and stateless rules.
# When it is set to 'optimal', logginng will only log the first packet of NEW
# sockets, accounting will only account the first packet of NEW sockets and
# stateless rules are disabled.
# When it is set to 'accurate', logging and accounting will be done for all
# packets and stateless rules are enabled.
# Default: accurate
# Possible Values: optimal accurate
FIREHOL_RULESET_MODE="accurate"

# Should we drop all INVALID packets always?
# INVALID packets as seen by the connection tracker.
# Check also the next section (SYSTEM CONFIGURATION) for related options.
# It can be enabled per interface using 'protection invalid'.
# This will be enabled if you use the synproxy helper.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID=1

# When FIREHOL_DROP_INVALID=1 shall we also log the droped packets?
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_LOG_DROP_INVALID=1

# If set to 1, FireHOL will silently drop orphan TCP packets with ACK,FIN set.
# In modern kernels, the connection tracker detects closed sockets
# and removes them from memory before receiving the FIN,ACK from the remote
# party. This makes FireHOL log these packets when they will be received.
# To silently drop these packets, enable this option.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_DROP_ORPHAN_TCP_ACK_FIN=1

# If enabled FireHOL will create a chain per server/client statement and jump
# to it from the main flow. Normaly this jump is only required for clarity.
# So it is advised to leave this setting to 0, for a more efficient firewall.
# Default: 0
FIREHOL_CHAIN_PER_SERVICE=0

# If enabled, FireHOL will use the multiport matches of iptables, when
# possible. Note that multiport matches in iptables do not support matching
# both source and destination ports on the same statement, with different
# ports for source and destination.
# So, FireHOL will only use it if sport or dport in set to 'any' (or not at
# all) or when sport and dport are the exactly the same ports.
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_SUPPORT_MULTIPORT=1

# There are matches that are more "expensive" than others. When enabled,
# FireHOL will use branching (create a new chain and jump to it) in order to
# avoid executing expensive matches more than once per statement.
# Expensive matches are: limit, connlimit, ipset (not when used in src/dst),
# helpers (for RELATED matches).
# Default: 1
FIREHOL_PROTECTED_MATCHES=1

# How to configure conntrack helper assignement?
#
# 'kernel'  = the kernel will attempt to match RELATED sockets for all
#             conntrack helpers and all traffic matching its predefined rules.
#             This is considered a security threat and should be avoided.
#             Check: https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/
#
# 'firehol' = FireHOL will generate rules in the 'raw' table, using the -j CT
#             target of iptables to match the flows of the statements
#             the conntrack helpers are used.
#             CAUTION: FireHOL generated statements are not NAT aware.
#             You should only use this, if you don't NAT traffic that have to
#             be seen by conntrack helpers to detect RELATED ports.
#
# 'manual'  = You configure conntrack helper assignement manually using
#             the 'cthelper' firehol helper.
#             In this case, neither the kernel nor FireHOL will do anything
#             about conntrack helpers assignement. 
#
# Default: kernel
FIREHOL_CONNTRACK_HELPERS_ASSIGNMENT="kernel"

# SYNPROXY options
# The options to pass to -j SYNPROXY

FIREHOL_SYNPROXY_OPTIONS="--sack-perm --timestamp --wscale 7 --mss 1460"

# Shall the SYNPROXY FireHOL helper log the packets as they pass during
# the various phases?
# Default: 0
FIREHOL_SYNPROXY_LOG=0

# When enabled, synproxy will exclude for the SYNPROXY->SERVER match
# all the packets that have an UID or a GID (ownmer matches).
# When enabled, dst is not required for synproxy and synproxy can
# be used on dynamic IPs (it requires an 'src not; though).
# Default: 0
FIREHOL_SYNPROXY_EXCLUDE_OWNER=0

# Trust loopback?
# loose     = Trust device lo unconditionally
# strict    = Trust only IPs 127.0.0.0/8 and ::1 on device lo
# Default: loose
FIREHOL_TRUST_LOOPBACK="loose"

# If set to non-empty, FireHOL will apply a global reverse filtering on all
# traffic. If you use connection tracker helpers, you should enable this.
# Check: https://home.regit.org/netfilter-en/secure-use-of-helpers/
# Default: <empty>
# Possible Values: <check: iptables -m rpfilter --help>
FIREHOL_GLOBAL_RPFILTER=

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPTABLES MARKS BITMASKING

# FireHOL allows multiple independent MARKs.
# By default FireHOL requires 'connmark' and 'usermark'.

# Mark types may be defined with this template:
#
# markdef NAME VALUES [stateful|stateless] [permanent|temporary]
#
#  NAME      = a name for this mark type
#              connmark and usermark should always be defined.
#
#  VALUES    = max number of marks to support (0 to VALUES - 1)
#              VALUES must be a power of two.
#
#  stateful  = all statements that assign this mark should 
#              only apply it on NEW packets.
#
#  stateless = all statements that assign this mark type should
#              only apply it only to traffic matched by the
#              optional rule parameters given.
#
#  temporary = do not save/restore to/from connection marks.
#              This means RESPONSES to the matched packets
#              will not get the mark.
#
#  permanent = save/restore to/from connection marks
#              This means that RESPONSES will get the mark.
#
# NOTES ABOUT markdef OPTIONS
#
# default is : stateful permanent or default
#              in this mode, only NEW packets of connections need
#              to be marked. ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets
#              will automatically get the same mark too.
#              So, in FireHOL mark helpers (connmark, mark, custommark)
#              you will only need to match a REQUEST packet and
#              automatically all the packets of the connection will
#              get the mark.
#
#            - stateful temporary
#              In this mode, only NEW packets will be marked for each
#              connection. ESTABLISHED and RELATED packets will NOT
#              get the mark.
#
#            - stateless permanent
#              In this mode, whatever the helper statement matches
#              will get the mark. This mark will also be applied to
#              all the packets that are encountered after the marked
#              packet and are part of the same socket.
#
#            - stateless temporary or classic
#              In this mode, only whatever the helper statement matches
#              will get the mark. Nothing else.
#

# clear the internal marks - do not remove this line
markdef clear

# connmarks are used by the connmark helper
markdef connmark 64

# usermark are used by the mark helper
markdef usermark 128

# Custom mark example:
#
# markdef qosmark 8
#
# To use it use 'custommark' helper and optional rule parameter.
# The first argument to both should the mark name (qosmark in this case)

# COMPLEX SERVICES DEFINITIONS
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following are definitions for complex services.
# We define as "complex" the services that are implemented using multiple sockets.

# Each function bellow is organized in three parts:
# 1) A Header, common to each and every function
# 2) The rules required for the INPUT of the server
# 3) The rules required for the OUTPUT of the server
#
# The Header part, together with the "reverse" keyword can reverse the rules so
# that if we are implementing a client the INPUT will become OUTPUT and vice versa.
#
# In most the cases the input and output rules are the same with the following
# differences:
#
# a) The output rules begin with the "reverse" keyword, which reverses:
#    inface/outface, src/dst, sport/dport
# b) The output rules use ${out}_${mychain} instead of ${in}_${mychain}
# c) The state rules match the client operation, not the server.

# --- NIS ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# These rules work for client access only!
#
# Pushing changes to slave servers won't work if these rules are active
# somewhere between the master and its slaves, because it is impossible to
# predict the ports where "yppush" will be listening on each push.
#
# Pulling changes directly on the slaves will work, and could be improved
# performance-wise if these rules are modified to open "fypxfrd". This wasn't
# done because it doesn't make that much sense since pushing changes on the
# master server is the most common, and recommended, way to replicate maps.

	# BRANCH OPTIMIZATION
	# 
	# Facts: - the caller expects us to add statements to a chain and
	#          perform the action only if all conditions are met - AND'd
	#          (multiple options to the same condition which are OR'd).
	#
	#          example:
	#
	#           inface "eth0 eth1" outface eth2 =
	#                ( ( inface=eth0 OR inface=eth1 ) AND outface=eth2 )
	#
	#          while
	#
	#           inface not "eth0 eth1" outface eth2 =
	#                ( inface!=eth0 AND inface!=eth1 AND outface=eth2 )
	#
	#          All conditions that are negative and have only one possible
	#          value to match, can be executed in the main loop (negative
	#          and positive conditions on the same command).
	#
	#        - we can only branch (i.e. create a chain and jump to it) only
	#          if the action is not RETURN. If it is RETURN, then we have
	#          only one exit point and we cannot do any complex expressions
	#
	#        - A branch is required when we have multiple values in
	#          positive conditions, to avoid executing certain features
	#          multiple times (I call these features: protected
	#          parameters, because we should protect them from multiple
	#          executions - a branch is cheaper than 2 of these)
	# 
	#        These require branching always:
	#        (we can only avoid it if we have a negative branch)
	# 
	#            * log
	#            * loglimit
	#            * accounting
	#
	#        These require branching if we are going to generate multiple statements:
	#        (so that they are applied only once per rule)
	#
	#            * limit
	#            * connlimit
	#            * ipset
	#            * helpers
	#            * custom rules
	#
	#        We will not stop though if we are not allowed to branch for them.
	#        We will just issue a warning that the generated firewall is not optimal.
	#
	# Let's calculate a few sums to help us take decisions:

	# negative_single               - counts the number of negative parameters that have just one possible value
	# positive_multi                - counts the number of positive parameters that have multiple values
	# negative_multi                - counts the number of negative parameters that have multiple values

FireHOL supports the following options (before any command):

	fast		sets FIREHOL_FAST_ACTIVATION=1

	nofast 		sets FIREHOL_FAST_ACTIVATION=0

	optimal		sets FIREHOL_RULESET_MODE="optimal"

	accurate	sets FIREHOL_RULESET_MODE="accurate"

	reset-ipsets 	removes and recreates all ipsets used.
			dynamic ipsets (such as the ones created
			by the iptrap helper), are not recreated
			so that they will keep their data.
			this option recreates them.


FireHOL supports the following commands (only one of them):

	start		to activate the firewall configuration.
			The configuration is expected to be found in
			${FIREHOL_CONFIG_DIR}/firehol.conf
			
	try		to activate the firewall, but wait until
			the user types the word "commit". If this word
			is not typed within 30 seconds, the previous
			firewall is restored.
			
	stop		to stop a running iptables firewall.
			This will allow all traffic to pass unchecked.
		
	restart		this is an alias for start and is given for
			compatibility with /etc/init.d/iptables.
			
	status		will show the running firewall, as in:
				${IPTABLES_CMD} -nxvL
			and
				${IP6TABLES_CMD} -nxvL
	
	cstatus		show connection tracker status

	panic		will block all IP communication.
	
	restore		will restore the last activated firewall.
			Useful for quickly restoring at boot the last
			successfully activated FireHOL firewall.

	save		to start the firewall and then save it to the
			place where /etc/init.d/iptables looks for it.
			
			Note that not all firewalls will work if
			restored with:
			/etc/init.d/iptables start
			
			The fastest way to restore a FireHOL firewall
			at boot is the 'restore' feature.

	debug		to parse the configuration file but instead of
			activating it, to show the generated iptables
			statements.
	
	explain		to enter interactive mode and accept configuration
			directives. It also gives the iptables commands
			for each directive together with reasoning.
			
	helpme	or	to enter a wizard mode where FireHOL will try
	wizard		to figure out the configuration you need.
			You can redirect the standard output of FireHOL to
			a file to get the config to this file.
			
	<a filename>	a different configuration file.
			If not other argument is given, the configuration
			will be "tried" (default = try).
			Otherwise the argument next to the filename can
			be one of 'start', 'debug' and 'try'.

FireHOL supports the following services (sorted by name):
EOF

Services marked with (*) are "smart" or complex services.
All the others are simple single socket services.

Please note that the service:
	
	all	matches all packets and all protocols, while ensuring that
		required kernel modules are loaded. Packets "untracked" by
		iptables (e.g. ICMPv6 neighbour discovery packets) are not
		included in "all" and must be handled separately.
	
	any	allows the matching of packets with unusual rules, like
		only protocol but no ports. If service any is used
		without other parameters, it does what service all does
		but it does not handle kernel modules.
		For example, to match GRE traffic use:
		
		server any mygre accept proto 47
		
		Service any does not handle kernel modules.
		
	custom	allows the definition of a custom service.
		The template is:
		
		server custom name protocol/sport cport accept
		
		where name is just a name, protocol is the protocol the
		service uses (tcp, udp, etc), sport is server port,
		cport is the client port. For example, IMAP4 is:
		
		server custom imap tcp/143 default accept

YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO? FireHOL can help you! Just run it with the
argument 'helpme' and it will generate its configuration file for this
machine. Your running firewall will not be altered or stopped, and no
systems settings will be modified. Just run:

${PROGRAM_FILE} helpme >/tmp/firehol.conf

and you will get the configuration written to /tmp/firehol.conf
